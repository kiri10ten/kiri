> Line art in blender is pretty simple and also fun using greese pencil

I am going to show you how you can create fun little sqaure with a line art around it

## 1 . Add a sqaure mesh or use the default cube mesh in the scene

## 2 . Now press shift a and select greese pencil -----> object line art

you will be seeing something like this

## 3. Now select the line art and go to modifier option,now adjust the line thickness,opacity as you need

## 4. Now add another modifier called thickness modifier to have much more liberty

## 5. Now you can also also adjust the custom curve to change the line stroke

thickness ----> influence ----> custom curve

you can see a difference like this

That's it ,Have fun !
